## Directory Fuzzing

As we can see from the example above, the main two options are `-w` for wordlists and `-u` for the URL. We can assign a wordlist to a keyword to refer to it where we want to fuzz. For example, we can pick our wordlist and assign the keyword `FUZZ` to it by adding `:FUZZ` after it:

  Directory Fuzzing

```shell-session
Pangulin@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ
```

Next, as we want to be fuzzing for web directories, we can place the `FUZZ` keyword where the directory would be within our URL, with:

  Directory Fuzzing

```shell-session
Pangulin@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w <SNIP> -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ
```

Now, let's start our target in the question below and run our final command on it:

  Directory Fuzzing

```shell-session
Pangulin@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ


        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

## Filtering

`Ffuf` provides the option to match or filter out a specific HTTP code, response size, or amount of words. We can see that with `ffuf -h`:

  Filtering Results

```shell-session
Pangulin@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -h
...SNIP...
MATCHER OPTIONS:
  -mc              Match HTTP status codes, or "all" for everything. (default: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403)
  -ml              Match amount of lines in response
  -mr              Match regexp
  -ms              Match HTTP response size
  -mw              Match amount of words in response

FILTER OPTIONS:
  -fc              Filter HTTP status codes from response. Comma separated list of codes and ranges
  -fl              Filter by amount of lines in response. Comma separated list of line counts and ranges
  -fr              Filter regexp
  -fs              Filter HTTP response size. Comma separated list of sizes and ranges
  -fw              Filter by amount of words in response. Comma separated list of word counts and ranges
