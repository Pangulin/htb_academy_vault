The first statement will be 
``show databases;``
because they are at the top of the pyramid


with the statement ``use "database name";`` we can select a database 

then we can use ``show tables;`` to look at the tables within this database 

we can use the statement ``select * from "tablename";`` to look at everything inside the selected table. 

for selecting only specific collums. 
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```
