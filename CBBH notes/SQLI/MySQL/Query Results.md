To control the output of our search queries 

## Sorting Results

we can use ```
 SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password;```
 to sort the output alphabetically in relation to the password collumn

you can also swith the output by ending the statement with DESC;

```shell-session
SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC;
```

---------------

we can limit the amount of results (rows) we get by using LIMIT 

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 2;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

we can start the LIMIT with an offset by specifing the startingpoint and how many rows should be included

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 1, 2;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note: the offset marks the order of the first record to be included, starting from 0. For the above, it starts and includes the 2nd record, and returns two values.

-------
we can specifically filter for data by using the WHERE clause 

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;
```

for example we can filter by the id value 

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE id > 1;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  4 | tom           | tom123!    | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

or even filter by specific names 

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins where username = 'admin';

+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining     |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin    | p@ssw0rd | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

---------
similar is the clause LIKE. It enables you to select records using a pattern 

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%';

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  4 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 15:19:02 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
```

in this case the % symbol acts as a wildcard and matches all characers after admin
similarly the _ can be used to match exactly one character 

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username like '___';

+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining     |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
|  3 | tom      | tom123!  | 2020-07-02 15:18:56 |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
```

to use multiple statements and filter even more specifically we can use the AND logic to string them togheter 

``select * from employees WHERE first_name LIKE 'Bar%' and  hire_date = '1990-01-01';
