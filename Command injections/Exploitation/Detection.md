## Command Injection Detection

When we visit the web application in the below exercise, we see a `Host Checker` utility that appears to ask us for an IP to check whether it is alive or not: ![Basic Exercise](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/109/cmdinj_basic_exercise_1.jpg)

We can try entering the localhost IP `127.0.0.1` to check the functionality, and as expected, it returns the output of the `ping` command telling us that the localhost is indeed alive: ![Basic Exercise](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/109/cmdinj_basic_exercise_2.jpg)

Although we do not have access to the source code of the web application, we can confidently guess that the IP we entered is going into a `ping` command since the output we receive suggests that. As the result shows a single packet transmitted in the ping command, the command used may be as follows:

```bash
ping -c 1 OUR_INPUT
```

## Command Injection Methods

To inject an additional command to the intended one, we may use any of the following operators:

| **Injection Operator** | **Injection Character** | **URL-Encoded Character** | **Executed Command**                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Semicolon              | `;`                     | `%3b`                     | Both                                       |
| New Line               | `\n`                    | `%0a`                     | Both                                       |
| Background             | `&`                     | `%26`                     | Both (second output generally shown first) |
| Pipe                   | `\|`                    | `%7c`                     | Both (only second output is shown)         |
| AND                    | `&&`                    | `%26%26`                  | Both (only if first succeeds)              |
| OR                     | `\|`                    | `%7c%7c`                  | Second (only if first fails)               |
| Sub-Shell              | ` `` `                  | `%60%60`                  | Both (Linux-only)                          |
| Sub-Shell              | `$()`                   | `%24%28%29`               | Both (Linux-only)                          |

We can use any of these operators to inject another command so `both` or `either` of the commands get executed. `We would write our expected input (e.g., an IP), then use any of the above operators, and then write our new command.`

``Tip: In addition to the above, there are a few unix-only operators, that would work on Linux and macOS, but would not work on Windows, such as wrapping our injected command with double backticks (` `` `) or with a sub-shell operator (`$()`).

``Note: The only exception may be the semi-colon `;`, which will not work if the command was being executed with `Windows Command Line (CMD)`, but would still work if it was being executed with `Windows PowerShell`.
