## Injecting Our Command

We can add a semi-colon after our input IP `127.0.0.1`, and then append our command (e.g. `whoami`), such that the final payload we will use is (`127.0.0.1; whoami`), and the final command to be executed would be:

```bash
ping -c 1 127.0.0.1; whoami
```

As we can see, the final command successfully runs, and we get the output of both commands (as mentioned in the previous table for `;`). Now, we can try using our previous payload in the `Host Checker` web application: ![Basic Injection](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/109/cmdinj_basic_injection.jpg)

As we can see, the web application refused our input, as it seems only to accept input in an IP format. However, from the look of the error message, it appears to be originating from the front-end rather than the back-end. We can double-check this with the `Firefox Developer Tools` by clicking `[CTRL + SHIFT + E]` to show the Network tab and then clicking on the `Check` button again:

As we can see, no new network requests were made when we clicked on the `Check` button, yet we got an error message. This indicates that the `user input validation is happening on the front-end`.

We can now customize our HTTP request and send it to see how the web application handles it. We will start by using the same previous payload (`127.0.0.1; whoami`). We should also URL-encode our payload to ensure it gets sent as we intend. We can do so by selecting the payload and then clicking `[CTRL + U]`. Finally, we can click `Send` to send our HTTP request:
